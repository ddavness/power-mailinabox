# Basic System Configuration
# -------------------------

# ### Set hostname of the box

# If the hostname is not correctly resolvable sudo can't be used. This will result in
# errors during the install
#
# First set the hostname in the configuration file, then activate the setting

echo $PRIMARY_HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname
hostname $PRIMARY_HOSTNAME

# ### Enable IPv6 at Kernel Level

# This doesn't mean that the cloud provider must provide IPv6 connectivity. We just want
# the loopback interface to also work on IPv6 (that is, we want :: to be available). This
# is required because apparently nsd expects this to exist.

management/editconf.py /etc/sysctl.conf "net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 0"
hide_output sysctl --system

# ### Fix permissions

# The default Ubuntu Bionic image on Scaleway throws warnings during setup about incorrect
# permissions (group writeable) set on the following directories.

chmod g-w /etc /etc/default /usr

# ### Set log retention policy.

# Set the systemd journal log retention from infinite to 10 days,
# since over time the logs take up a large amount of space.
# (See https://discourse.mailinabox.email/t/journalctl-reclaim-space-on-small-mailinabox/6728/11.)
management/editconf.py /etc/systemd/journald.conf MaxRetentionSec=10day

# ### Update Packages

# Update system packages to make sure we have the latest upstream versions
# of things from Ubuntu, as well as the directory of packages provide by the
# PPAs so we can install those packages later.

echo Updating system packages...
hide_output apt-get update
apt_get_quiet upgrade

# Old kernels pile up over time and take up a lot of disk space, and because of Mail-in-a-Box
# changes there may be other packages that are no longer needed. Clear out anything apt knows
# is safe to delete.

apt_get_quiet autoremove

# ### Install System Packages

# Install basic utilities.
#
# * unattended-upgrades: Apt tool to install security updates automatically.
# * cron: Runs background processes periodically.
# * fail2ban: scans log files for repeated failed login attempts and blocks the remote IP at the firewall
# * netcat-openbsd: `nc` command line networking tool
# * git: we install some things directly from github
# * sudo: allows privileged users to execute commands as root without being root
# * coreutils: includes `nproc` tool to report number of processors, mktemp
# * bc: allows us to do math to compute sane defaults
# * openssh-client: provides ssh-keygen

# because we don't yet support it.

# ### Set the system timezone
#
# Some systems are missing /etc/timezone, which we cat into the configs for
# Z-Push and ownCloud, so we need to set it to something. Daily cron tasks
# like the system backup are run at a time tied to the system timezone, so
# letting the user choose will help us identify the right time to do those
# things (i.e. late at night in whatever timezone the user actually lives
# in).
#
# However, changing the timezone once it is set seems to confuse fail2ban
# and requires restarting fail2ban (done below in the fail2ban
# section) and syslog (see #328). There might be other issues, and it's
# not likely the user will want to change this, so we only ask on first
# setup.

		# tool.

# ### Local DNS Service

# Install a local recursive DNS server --- i.e. for DNS queries made by
# local services running on this machine.
#
# (This is unrelated to the box's public, non-recursive DNS server that
# answers remote queries about domain names hosted on this box. For that
# see dns.sh.)
#
# The default systemd-resolved service provides local DNS name resolution. By default it
# is a recursive stub nameserver, which means it simply relays requests to an
# external nameserver, usually provided by your ISP or configured in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.
#
# This won't work for us for three reasons.
#
# 1) We have higher security goals --- we want DNSSEC to be enforced on all
#    DNS queries (some upstream DNS servers do, some don't).
# 2) We will configure postfix to use DANE, which uses DNSSEC to find TLS
#    certificates for remote servers. DNSSEC validation *must* be performed
#    locally because we can't trust an unencrypted connection to an external
#    DNS server.
# 3) DNS-based mail server blacklists (RBLs) typically block large ISP
#    DNS servers because they only provide free data to small users. Since
#    we use RBLs to block incoming mail from blacklisted IP addresses,
#    we have to run our own DNS server. See #1424.
#
# systemd-resolved has a setting to perform local DNSSEC validation on all
# requests (in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, set DNSSEC=yes), but because it's
# a stub server the main part of a request still goes through an upstream
# DNS server, which won't work for RBLs. So we really need a local recursive
# nameserver.
#
# We'll install `bind9`, which as packaged for Ubuntu, has DNSSEC enabled by default via "dnssec-validation auto".
# We'll have it be bound to 127.0.0.1 so that it does not interfere with
# the public, recursive nameserver `nsd` bound to the public ethernet interfaces.
#
# About the settings:
#
# * Adding -4 to OPTIONS will have `bind9` not listen on IPv6 addresses
#   so that we're sure there's no conflict with nsd, our public domain
#   name server, on IPV6.
# * The listen-on directive in named.conf.options restricts `bind9` to
#   binding to the loopback interface instead of all interfaces.
# * The max-recursion-queries directive increases the maximum number of iterative queries.
#  	If more queries than specified are sent, bind9 returns SERVFAIL. After flushing the cache during system checks,
#	we ran into the limit thus we are increasing it from 75 (default value) to 100.
apt_install bind9
touch /etc/default/bind9
touch /etc/default/named
management/editconf.py /etc/default/bind9 \
	"OPTIONS=\"-u bind -4\""
management/editconf.py /etc/default/named \

if ! grep -q "listen-on " /etc/bind/named.conf.options; then
	# Add a listen-on directive if it doesn't exist inside the options block.
	sed -i "s/^}/\n\tlisten-on { 127.0.0.1; };\n}/" /etc/bind/named.conf.options
fi
if ! grep -q "max-recursion-queries " /etc/bind/named.conf.options; then

fi

# First we'll disable systemd-resolved's management of resolv.conf and its stub server.
# Breaking the symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf means
# systemd-resolved will read it for DNS servers to use. Put in 127.0.0.1,
# which is where bind9 will be running. Obviously don't do this before
# installing bind9 or else apt won't be able to resolve a server to
# download bind9 from.

# ### Fail2Ban Service

# Configure the Fail2Ban installation to prevent dumb bruce-force attacks against dovecot, postfix, ssh, etc.
rm -f /etc/fail2ban/jail.local # we used to use this file but don't anymore
rm -f /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/defaults-debian.conf # removes default config so we can manage all of fail2ban rules in one config
cat conf/fail2ban/jails.conf \
    | sed "s/PUBLIC_IPV6/$PUBLIC_IPV6/g" \
	| sed "s/PUBLIC_IP/$PUBLIC_IP/g" \
	| sed "s#STORAGE_ROOT#$STORAGE_ROOT#" \
	> /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/mailinabox.conf
cp -f conf/fail2ban/filter.d/* /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/

# On first installation, the log files that the jails look at don't all exist.
# e.g., The roundcube error log isn't normally created until someone logs into
# Roundcube for the first time. This causes fail2ban to fail to start. Later
# scripts will ensure the files exist and then fail2ban is given another
# restart at the very end of setup.
restart_service fail2ban

systemctl enable fail2ban
